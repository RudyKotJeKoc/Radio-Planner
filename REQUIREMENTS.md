## ⚠️ What's Missing (For Full Functionality)

### Music Files (Manual Addition Required)
The application references 207 music files in `playlist.json`, but the actual `.mp3` files need to be added manually:

```
music/
├── Utwor (1).mp3   # "Kaput!" by Daremon Band
├── Utwor (2).mp3   # "BMW jeździ chujowo" by DJ Bóbr
├── Utwor (3).mp3   # "Plasdan padł (Remix)"
├── Utwor (4).mp3   # "Rompa (Disco Version)"
├── Utwor (5).mp3   # "DAREMON Radio – Jingle"
└── ... (202 more tracks)
```

**Why not included:**
- Large file sizes (hundreds of MB)

- Company-specific content
